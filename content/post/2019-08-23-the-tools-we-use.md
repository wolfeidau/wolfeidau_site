I use vscode in my daily work, it is one of the first things I open each day. The stack I work with is pretty varied, but i can be summarised as:

* Cloudformation, native infrastructure deployment 
* Python, used for cloud orchestration, lambda and scripting
* NodeJS using Typescript, for lambda development
* React development mostly using Typescript
* Go, tooling and network services
* Git, used for all things source code

I am a heavy user of the shell, with most of my builds done using the good old `Makefile`.

## Plugins

To support this stack I use the following plugins:

* [Code Spell Checker]()
* [Docker]()
* [EditorConfig for VS Code]()
* [GitLens â€” Git supercharged]()
* [Go]() 
* [indent-rainbow]()
* [Python]()
* [vscode-cfn-lint]()
* [npm]()
* [prettier]()
