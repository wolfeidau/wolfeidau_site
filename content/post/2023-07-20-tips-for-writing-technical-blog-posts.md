I was recently asked put together a list of tips for writing technical blog posts. Here are some of my recommendations:

# Understand SEO

Have some basic SEO practices in place. This includes:

1. Select a good Title, make it descriptive and use relevant keywords
2. Add Meta-data to your post, include important keywords as tags in the HTML head section 
3. Select a URL, Use clean, keyword-rich URLs for each post
4. Internal linking, link to other relevant posts on your site
5. External linking, link to reputable sources related to your post, ensure you always link to product landing pages and any helpful resources, and include any references used.

I try to ensure all the major products, subjects and technologies are linked in the first paragraph of the post.

## Have a clear goal

Know what you want to achieve with the post and who your target audience is. This will help guide the content and tone.

For me personally my blog is about sharing experiences, solutions and recommendations to help other engineers. So my goal is to provide value and help solve problems.

Write the posts you want to read yourself. If you find the topic interesting and valuable, chances are others will too. 

There is nothing quite like searching for a solution solution via google and discovering your own article a couple of years later. Your colleagues and peers will appreciate the insight and knowledge sharing as well.

## Do your research

Make sure you understand the topic in depth before writing about it. Read other posts and resources to learn best practices.

Dig into every aspect of the technology or solution you are discussing:

1. Understand the basics and history
2. Read documentation and do the tutorials
3. Take the time to actually implement, re-implement it yourself 
4. Capture edge cases, gotchas and pitfalls to include in your post

This will help ensure you provide accurate and thorough information, which will in turn help develop skills which are useful in your day to day work.

## Have a clear structure

Use headings, lists, and code blocks to break up the content and make it scannable. Also use examples. Include relevant code snippets, diagrams, screenshots, or other examples to illustrate your points.

If there is too much code, just include fragments, and create a GitHub/GitLab repo with the full examples. This can be linked to in the post, and ensure that project links back to the blog post to help build relevance.

## Keep it concise

Long-form content is less likely to be read. Aim for 1000-1500 words for a technical blog post.

Write for the reader, use simple and direct language and avoid jargon where possible.

Always clearly spell out all acronyms when you first use them.

Include a call to action. Tell the reader what you want them to do after reading the post. Implement a solution? Leave feedback? Share the article?

## Share posts with your Peers

Make sure you share your post on relevant social media channels. This is critical to getting your content discovered. 

Ensure you talk with your peers and colleagues, ask them to give feedback, this is one of my key sources of improvement.

Personally I use twitter, Versent Slack, Hacker News to share my posts. I also share within slack communities I am a member of and ask for feedback from my team.
