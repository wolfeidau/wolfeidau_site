# Mark Wolfe

I have spent the last 25 years working in the software industry, across operations, software development and leadership. I have worked across a number of industries with experience in telecommunications, government, internet of things (IoT) and cloud. Most of my career has been walking the line between consulting or product development, having worked between these two specialisations in a number of organisations.

More recently I have spent the last 8 years working with Versent, an AWS premier consulting partner based in Australia. I have worked in a number of roles initially in the consulting business, then in a product business called Stax.

From the very beginning with Versent I was working in AWS, initially with enterprise customers moving into cloud, then providing direction and support to teams across the business working with customers in AWS.

I have a passion for creating and supporting the teams of software developers, my primary goal is keep everything on track while ensuring no one is left behind. I have successfully delivered projects, and products in some of the largest enterprises in Australia, while working with partners like AWS.

More recently I have been focusing on data processing, AI, and Machine Learning in my spare time.
