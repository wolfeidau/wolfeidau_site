# Mark Wolfe

I have spent the last 25 years working in the software industry, across operations, software development and leadership. I have worked across a number of industries with experience in telecommunications, government, internet of things (IoT) and cloud. Most of my career has been walking the line between consulting or product development, having worked between these two specialisations in a number of organisations.

More recently I have spent the last 8 years working with Versent, an AWS premier consulting partner based in Australia. I have worked in a number of roles initially in the consulting business, then in a product business called Stax.

At Versent, my primary focus was AWS, initially assisting enterprise customers with cloud migrations, then providing direction and support to teams as they worked with customers in AWS.

I have a passion for creating and supporting teams of software developers. My primary goal is to keep projects on track while ensuring no team member is left behind. I have successfully delivered projects and products for some of the largest enterprises in Australia, working in partnership with AWS.

More recently I have been focusing on data processing, AI, and Machine Learning in my spare time.
