I have spent the last two years working at [Ninja Blocks](https://ninjablocks.com/), which is an IoT startup based in Sydney. When I started I was working on keeping the existing systems running, developing new deployment tools and tuning the existing platform, then early in 2014 I was asked to take over as CTO.

As CTO I worked with the team to build the [Ninja Sphere](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ninja/ninja-sphere-next-generation-control-of-your-envir), a consumer focused hardware device and cloud services which we launched on kickstarter in November 2013. This project took us ~14 months to build, going from design, firmware / hardware build through to manufacturing and finally shipping. This was one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I have ever worked on.

While at Ninja Blocks I to worked across a wide array of disciplines including hardware, software development and business operations. On the engineering side I primarily worked on:

* Real time messaging from the devices to cloud services
* API Development
* Linux OS development working with drivers, software packaging, and building the firmware for an ARM based platform
* Deployment of cloud services on AWS, Google Cloud with Chef, Ansible and Docker
* Building microservices
* Compliance testing and certification of hardware

Before Ninja Blocks I worked for 13 years as an architect and consultant at Hammond Street Developments which is a mid sized IT consulting company located out in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. In this role I worked on a large array of projects / contracts within the education, telecommunications and the banking sectors. I got the opportunity to work all over Australia, and New Zealand on many varied and challenging projects.
